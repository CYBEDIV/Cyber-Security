-------------------------------------------------------------------
In computer Networking, a proxy server is a server application 
that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource
and the server providing that resource.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Every time request something on the internet with real ip, your 
request go through to the proxy server so the proxy server will 
provide you the resource made a request through the proxy server IP,
so ip addr not be left there means you are anonymous.   
---------
here we can change the Network setting as per our requirements 
three types of proxy chain
random or dynamic or strict [chains]
1 Strick chain_________________
all proxies of the list will be used. And they will be chained in an
ordered way. But if there any dead proxy in your list
,then your connection is gone
2 Dynamic Chain________________
Almost similar to the strict chain, but if there is any dead proxy in
your list, it will be skipped to the next proxy........
3. Ransom Cjain_______________     
A random proxy will be used from your proxy list. 
each connection made through proxy chains will be done via a random 
combo of proxies
-----------------------------------------
default use strick proxy 
but if you want to change then remove hash form the proxy type.
----------------------------
I prefer Dynamic so remove hash from dynamic and add hash on strick proxy
